                    When creating the "Food Recall App" there were many important components that went into it's development. After initially
                huddling together to come up with an app concept and it's usefulness, this was the perfect app concept. Working
                as a team we've been able to successfully incorporate: A Barcode API, FDA API, Firebase, Materialize and
                Mobile Responsiveness. Below states the importance of each component in relation to the functionality of
                the app.

                <br></br>
                <p>Barcode API: This API has been incorporated into the app to allow users of the app to have a broader search
                    variety when searching for product recalls. While the app includes the option of searching by company,
                    and product name including this API allows users to narrow their search to that specific item. </p>
                <br>
                </br>

                <p>FDA API: This API is an integral part of our web app. It's what binds everything together. We use the FDA
                    API to access FDA stored information about products that have been recalled. For example information
                    pertaining to: the date a product was recalled, why it was recalled, the name and discription of the
                    product etc... Our app waits for the user's search parameters, then uses the API to find results within
                    those parameters, and then displays the results back to the user.</p>
                <br>
                </br>

                <p>Firebase: Provides a live database and backend service for this application. The service provides developers
                    an API that allows app data to be synchronized between different product users in real-time. Then being
                    stored onto firebase's cloud taking the user search results and storing them in their live database.
                    To be displayed on the page in the recent search section of the page.</p>
                <br>
                </br>

                <p>Materialize: We decided to include this framework because it's a component library created with CSS, JavaScript,
                    and HTML. Materialize components help with constructing functional web pages and web apps</p>
                <br>
                </br>

                <p>Mobile Responsiveness: Allows users the convenience of being able to use the application on a cellphone or
                    tablet and not just on their computer. </p>
